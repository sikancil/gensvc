# INTRODUCTION
We are a backend and devops team that mostly face such repeatedly works when a job coming to our team. The job mostly requested for any all combinations or may single of services or microservices architecture, depending how our TechLead or CTO gave us the system architecture.

## Background Story
We mostly face build backend service and/or microservice from scratches (fresh) on such repeatedly works when a job coming to our backend and devops teams. Mostly our framework using Nestjs and/or Expressjs. deployment locally and/or production through docker or kubernetes.

## Problems
The job mostly requested for any all combinations or may single of services or microservices architecture, depending how our TechLead or CTO gave us the system architecture.

## Goal
Our team hope can have final product such **configurable and generate/automation build by utilises such boilerplates** which contains such:
- features that can be easy and seamless to configure enabled/disabled along with other settings/config that effectively and efficiently, 
- should not causes issue on the performances, 
- can have automation mechanism to simplify creation of such services or microservices for any codebase architecture purposes that can be **generate and automate/simplify the creation with CLI command**.

**Supported features mostly**: 
1. API Gateway
2. Standalone service/microservice
3. Transport layer: redis or kafka or additionally http/websocket
4. Caching Strategy with Redis
5. Task/Job/Queue/Schedule with Redis
6. WebSocket with and without socket.io, can be pure websocket or both with socket.io
7. Notification with FCM
8. Sequelize and Prisma, but NOT TypeORM
9. Authentication and/or with Authorization, options:
   * Email+Password
   * Email+Password with Google Auth (user can setup password additionally when first signed using Google OAuth2/OIDC)
   * Firebase Auth
   * Supabase Auth (optional; future improvement)
10. Permissions-based access level control. The roles are implemented as set/template of permissions for easier given such permissions access, but code/implementation manage with permission access
11. Health check
12. Seamless and easy deployment including scales
13. Logger with LogLevel implementation, compatible with any OpenTelemetry
14. Error Handling
15. Schema or input validation with Zod. Utilize and maximal the advantage integration with Zod
16. Can operate directly with data sources (database, cloud storage, or API endpoints)
17. Centralized such into a package that contains utils and standardized types/interfaces, constants/enums, small services and more... goal is to avoid duplications or redundancies or confuses or misleadings such code/implementation and to simplify code implementation on service/microservice, for example only: auth, data operation, and more...
18. Codebase System architecture (monorepo) integration detailed analysis and summaries
19. LLM integration to help review the generated analysis and summaries, so can help guide or direction to configure for add new or manage existing such service/microservice, refinements and/or adjustment, connecting with existing codebase, minimalistic or prevention such human-error, and more **smart and intelligence to make the developer life easier and save more time** for other productivity.
20. A new service or microservice can be added/attached to existing architecture seamlessly and smartly able to identified such standard implementations or guidelines, for example such: how auth works and endpoints, how caching works, how transport layer works, how it can communicate with another external or internal services, how it can discover/attached with API Gateway, and more **smart and intelligence to make the developer life easier and save more time** for other productivity.

## Examples
1. System architecture that required a single service only
2. System architecture that requires a single main service and some/few microservices on such executions
3. System architecture that required fully microservices implementation
4. System architecture that requires dynamic addition of service or microservice along the time the system or operational it's growth, can do replacement such service into several microservices, or fully replacement a service with a microservice, or adding new multiple microservice, or add several services, or any strategy depend to situation of operational it self.
5. Transport layer mostly use only one, either redis or kafka, but additionally also can use http/websocket

Think hard! while examinations and evaluations those context above with carefully, accurately, and accordingly. Then by analyses properly and correctly, build focus and detailed documented plans into such requirements and specifications. You can breakdown your response into multiple responses to respect maximum context output tokens. Ask me to continue or to clarify or such confirmation.

***

Here is a detailed plan breaking down the strategy, architecture, and implementation roadmap.

### Part 1: Feasibility Analysis and High-Level Strategy

**Deadline Acknowledgement:** The entire feature set, especially the advanced "smart" and LLM integrations (features #18, #19, #20), is highly ambitious. A production-grade tool of this nature would typically take weeks or months to build and stabilize.

**Proposed Strategy: Phased Development**
I propose a two-phased approach:
1.  **Phase 1 (The MVP):** Focus on building the core CLI generator and a robust boilerplate with the most critical, foundational features. The goal is to deliver a functional and valuable tool within the deadline that can already significantly speed up development.
2.  **Phase 2 (Post-MVP Roadmap):** Evolve the MVP by layering on the more complex, "intelligent" features, and expanding support for all the requested options.

This strategy ensures you have a tangible, working product quickly while providing a clear path forward for the more advanced capabilities.

### Part 2: Core Technology Stack

To build the generator and the boilerplate, we need to select the right tools for the job.

| Component             | Recommended Technology                                | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CLI Framework**     | **`oclif`** or **`commander.js`** + **`inquirer.js`** | `oclif` is a feature-rich framework for building CLIs. A combination of `commander.js` for command parsing and `inquirer.js` for interactive prompts offers great flexibility and a polished user experience.                                                                              |
| **Monorepo Manager**  | **Nx**                                                | Nx is exceptionally well-suited for this use case. It provides powerful code generation (schematics), dependency graph visualization, smart rebuilds, and first-class support for NestJS and ExpressJS, making it ideal for managing the architecture you've described.                    |
| **Templating Engine** | **EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates)**               | EJS is simple and powerful, allowing us to use plain JavaScript within our template files to dynamically include or exclude code blocks, configure modules, and modify files based on the user's CLI choices.                                                                              |
| **Base Framework**    | **NestJS**                                            | NestJS's modular architecture, dependency injection system, and use of decorators make it the perfect foundation for a configurable boilerplate where features can be cleanly added or removed. It uses ExpressJS by default but can be configured with Fastify for performance if needed. |

---

### Part 3: Architectural Design

This covers the architecture of both the CLI generator itself and the code it will generate.

#### A. Generator (CLI Tool) Architecture

The CLI tool will operate based on a configuration-driven, template-based approach.

1.  **Interactive Configuration:** When a developer runs `create-service`, the CLI will launch an interactive session (using `inquirer.js`) asking a series of questions:
    *   What is the name of the new service? (e.g., `user-service`)
    *   What type of application is this? (`Standalone Microservice`, `API Gateway`)
    *   Which ORM will you use? (`Prisma`, `Sequelize`, `None`)
    *   Select an authentication strategy: (`Email/Password`, `Firebase Auth`, `None`)
    *   Enable Redis for Caching/Queues? (`Yes`/`No`)
    *   Select a transport layer for microservice communication: (`Redis`, `Kafka`, `None`)
    *   ...and so on for other features.

2.  **Configuration Object:** The answers will be compiled into a single JSON configuration object.
    ```json
    {
      "serviceName": "user-service",
      "appType": "Standalone",
      "orm": "Prisma",
      "auth": "EmailPassword",
      "redis": true,
      "transport": "Redis",
      ...
    }
    ```

3.  **Template Processing:** The CLI will then copy a base NestJS project template from its source. It will iterate through the template files (`.ejs` files) and process them:
    *   **File Renaming:** Files can be named conditionally (e.g., `prisma.service.ts.ejs` vs. `sequelize.service.ts.ejs`).
    *   **Content Generation:** The EJS engine will use the configuration object to render the final code. For example, if `redis` is `true`, it will include the `RedisModule` in the main `app.module.ts.ejs`.
    *   **Dependency Management:** The CLI will dynamically build the `package.json` file, adding dependencies like `@nestjs/microservices`, `kafkajs`, `bullmq`, `prisma`, or `sequelize` only when they are needed.

4.  **Final Steps:** After generating the code, the CLI will automatically run `npm install` or `yarn install` to finish the setup.

#### B. Generated Codebase Architecture (The Boilerplate)

The generated code will be structured within an **Nx monorepo** for maximum scalability and code sharing.

```
/monorepo-root
├── apps/
│   ├── api-gateway/         <-- Generated API Gateway
│   └── user-service/        <-- Generated Standalone Service
│       ├── src/
│       │   ├── modules/
│       │   │   ├── auth/      <-- Auth module (generated if chosen)
│       │   │   ├── health/    <-- Health check module (default)
│       │   │   └── user/      <-- Example feature module
│       │   ├── main.ts
│       │   └── app.module.ts

│       ├── .env.example
│       └── package.json
├── libs/
│   └── shared/              <-- Centralized package (Feature #17)
│       ├── src/
│       │   ├── constants/

│       │   ├── guards/
│       │   └── types/
│       └── package.json
├── nx.json
└── package.json
```

**Key Implementation Details for Generated Features:**

*   **Configuration (`ConfigModule`):** All services will use NestJS's `@nestjs/config` module, loading variables from `.env` files. Environment variable validation will be handled using Zod to ensure type safety and correctness.
*   **Centralized Library (`libs/shared`):** This library will house shared code to avoid duplication, as you requested. This includes:
    *   Standardized DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and interfaces.
    *   Custom decorators (e.g., `@User()`, `@Public()`).
    *   Authentication guards and strategies that can be imported by any service.
    *   Shared constants and enums.
*   **Database (Prisma/Sequelize):** The generator will create a `DatabaseModule` that configures either Prisma Client or Sequelize based on the user's choice.
*   **Authentication & Permissions:**
    *   Authentication will be handled in a dedicated `AuthModule`. The generator will scaffold the necessary strategies (e.g., JWT, Google OAuth).
    *   Permissions-based access will be implemented using NestJS Guards. A `PermissionsGuard` will check if the authenticated user's role contains the required permission for a specific endpoint, which is specified with a decorator (e.g., `@HasPermission('create:user')`).
*   **Logging & Error Handling:**
    *   A custom logger (compatible with OpenTelemetry) will be implemented and globally registered.
    *   A global exception filter will catch all unhandled errors and format them into a standardized JSON response structure.
*   **Zod Integration:** Zod will be used not just for input validation (via a `ZodValidationPipe`) but also for environment variable validation and for defining type-safe DTOs, maximizing its benefits.

---

### Part 4: Implementation Plan (The MVP)

This is a realistic breakdown of what can be accomplished to create a highly valuable core product.

**Plan #P1: Foundation and Core Service Generation**

1.  **CLI Tool Setup (4 hours or less):**
    *   Initialize a new Node.js project.
    *   Set up `commander.js` for command parsing (`create-service`).
    *   Set up `inquirer.js` for the initial set of questions (service name, ORM choice, auth choice).
2.  **Base Template Creation (6 hours or less):**
    *   Create the master Nx monorepo template.
    *   Build a standard, high-quality NestJS application to serve as the core boilerplate.
    *   Implement foundational, non-optional features:
        *   Centralized logging module.
        *   Global error handling filter.
        *   Health check module (`/health`).
        *   Dockerfile for containerization.
        *   Setup `@nestjs/config` with Zod for environment validation.
3.  **ORM Integration (6 hours or less):**
    *   Develop the EJS templates for both Prisma and Sequelize.
    *   Write the CLI logic to generate the correct ORM configuration, module, and `package.json` dependencies based on user input.

**Plan #P2: Authentication, Connectivity, and Refinement**

1.  **Authentication & Authorization (6 hours or less):**
    *   Implement the Email+Password authentication flow (`AuthModule`) using JWT.
    *   Create templates for user registration, login, and a protected endpoint.
    *   Scaffold the basic `PermissionsGuard` and `@HasPermission()` decorator structure.
2.  **Redis Integration (Cache & Transport) (6 hours or less):**
    *   Add CLI prompts to enable Redis.
    *   Create templates for a basic caching module (`@nestjs/cache-manager`).
    *   Implement the Redis transport option for microservice communication in `main.ts`.
3.  **Documentation & Testing (4 hours or less):**
    *   Write a `README.md` for the generator tool, explaining how to use it.
    *   Write a `README.md` for the generated boilerplate, explaining the project structure and how to run it.
    *   Manually run through all generation combinations to test and fix bugs.

**MVP Deliverable:** By the end we will have a CLI tool that can generate a new NestJS monorepo with a standalone microservice. The service will be containerized and include a choice of ORM, a complete JWT authentication system, Redis integration for caching/transport, and best-practice implementations for logging, configuration, and error handling.

---

### Part 5: Roadmap and Future Enhancements (Phase 2)

Once the MVP is delivered and in use, you can incrementally add the remaining features.

1.  **Expand Feature Support:**
    *   **API Gateway:** Add a new application type to the CLI to generate a dedicated NestJS API Gateway that proxies requests to other services.
    *   **Transports:** Add full support for Kafka.
    *   **Auth:** Implement Google OAuth, Firebase Auth, and Supabase Auth strategies.
    *   **Queues & Schedulers:** Integrate BullMQ for robust job queue management.
    *   **WebSockets:** Add options for native WebSockets and Socket.IO.
    *   **Notifications:** Implement the FCM integration.

2.  **"Smart" Integration (Feature #20):**
    *   **Automated Gateway Updates:** Enhance the CLI to be "architecture-aware." When generating a new service, it could automatically update the API Gateway's configuration to add the new route.
    *   **Service Discovery:** Instead of static configuration, the boilerplate could be pre-configured to use a service discovery tool like Consul or rely on Kubernetes DNS for inter-service communication.

3.  **LLM Integration (Feature #19):**
    *   This is the most advanced feature. The CLI could be enhanced with a new command like `review-architecture`.
    *   This command would:
        *   Use `nx graph` to get a JSON representation of the dependency graph.
        *   Summarize the project structure and the user's stated goal.
        *   Send this context to a powerful LLM (like the Gemini API) with a carefully crafted prompt asking it to "review the proposed changes, identify potential integration challenges, and suggest best practices for connecting the new service."
        *   Display the LLM's response as guidance to the developer. This acts as an intelligent assistant, saving time and preventing errors.

### Part 6: Detailed Implementation Plan & Technical Specifications (The MVP)

This section contains the specific, actionable steps for the development cycle.

#### **Plan #P1: Foundation and Core Service Generation**

**Task 1.1: CLI Tool Setup (4 Hours or less)**

*   **Action:** Initialize a new Node.js project for the CLI tool (`mkdir /app && cd /app && npm init -y`). If already current project directory, and `package.json` exist, skip this step, otherwise initialize `package.json` with command `npm init -y`.
*   **Dependencies:** Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    npm install commander inquirer ejs fs-extra shelljs chalk
    ```
    *   `commander`: For command-line argument parsing.
    *   `inquirer`: For interactive prompts.
    *   `ejs`: For templating.
    *   `fs-extra`: A more powerful version of the `fs` module for file system operations.
    *   `shelljs`: For running shell commands like `npm install`.
    *   `chalk`: For styling console output.
*   **CLI Entry Point (`index.js`):**
    ```javascript
    #!/usr/bin/env node
    import { Command } from 'commander';
    import inquirer from 'inquirer';
    // ... other imports

    const program = new Command();

    program
      .command('create-service')
      .description('Generate a new NestJS service or microservice')
      .action(async () => {
        const answers = await inquirer.prompt([
          // Questions will be defined here
        ]);
        // Logic to process answers and generate code will go here
      });

    program.parse(process.argv);
    ```
*   **CLI Questions (`inquirer` prompts):**
    1.  `name`: 'projectName', `message`: 'What is the name of your monorepo project?'
    2.  `name`: 'serviceName', `message`: 'What is the name of the first service?'
    3.  `type`: 'list', `name`: 'orm', `message`: 'Which ORM will you use?', `choices`: ['Prisma', 'Sequelize']
    4.  `type`: 'confirm', `name`: 'useRedis', `message`: 'Enable Redis for Caching and Queues?'
    5.  `type`: 'list', `name`: 'auth', `message`: 'Select an authentication strategy:', `choices`: ['Email + Password (JWT)', 'None']

**Task 1.2: Base Boilerplate Template Creation (6 Hours or less)**

*   **Action:** Inside the CLI project, create a `templates/` directory. This will hold the entire source code for the boilerplate.
*   **Structure (`templates/base`):**
    ```
    /templates/base/
    ├── apps/
    │   └── <%= serviceName %>/
    │       ├── src/
    │       │   ├── common/
    │       │   │   ├── filters/exception.filter.ts.ejs
    │       │   │   └── pipes/zod-validation.pipe.ts
    │       │   ├── config/
    │       │   │   └── configuration.ts.ejs
    │       │   ├── modules/
    │       │   │   └── health/
    │       │   │       ├── health.controller.ts
    │       │   │       └── health.module.ts
    │       │   ├── main.ts.ejs
    │       │   └── app.module.ts.ejs
    │       ├── Dockerfile
    │       └── .env.example
    ├── libs/
    │   └── shared/
    │       └── ... (will be detailed later)
    ├── package.json.ejs
    └── nx.json
    ```*   **Key File Logic (`.ejs`):**
    *   **`main.ts.ejs`:** This file will be responsible for setting up the NestJS application. It will conditionally include microservice transport logic.
        ```typescript
        // main.ts.ejs
        <% if (useRedis) { %>
        import { Transport } from '@nestjs/microservices';
        <% } %>

        async function bootstrap() {
          const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);

          <% if (useRedis) { %>
          app.connectMicroservice({
            transport: Transport.REDIS,
            options: {
              host: process.env.REDIS_HOST,
              port: parseInt(process.env.REDIS_PORT, 10),
            },
          });
          await app.startAllMicroservices();
          <% } %>

          await app.listen(3000);
        }
        bootstrap();
        ```
    *   **`app.module.ts.ejs`:** This is the heart of the configuration. It will conditionally import other modules.
        ```typescript
        // app.module.ts.ejs
        import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
        import { ConfigModule } from '@nestjs/config';
        <% if (orm === 'Prisma') { %>
        import { PrismaModule } from './modules/prisma/prisma.module';
        <% } %>
        <% if (orm === 'Sequelize') { %>
        import { SequelizeModule } from '@nestjs/sequelize';
        <% } %>
        <% if (auth === 'Email + Password (JWT)') { %>
        import { AuthModule } from './modules/auth/auth.module';
        <% } %>

        @Module({
          imports: [
            ConfigModule.forRoot({ isGlobal: true }),
            HealthModule,
            <% if (orm === 'Prisma') { %>PrismaModule,<% } %>
            <% if (auth === 'Email + Password (JWT)') { %>AuthModule,<% } %>
            // ... other module imports
          ],
        })
        export class AppModule {}
        ```

**Task 1.3: ORM Integration (6 Hours or less)**

*   **Action:** Create separate template directories for each ORM to keep the logic clean.
    *   `templates/features/orm/prisma`
    *   `templates/features/orm/sequelize`
*   **Prisma:**
    *   Create a `prisma/schema.prisma` file with a sample `User` model.
    *   Create a `PrismaModule` and `PrismaService` that initializes and provides the `PrismaClient`. The generator will copy these files if `orm === 'Prisma'`.
*   **Sequelize:**
    *   Create a `database.module.ts.ejs` that uses `@nestjs/sequelize` and `SequelizeModule.forRootAsync` to connect to the database using config values.
    *   Create a sample `User` model using Sequelize decorators.
*   **Generator Logic:** The CLI will copy the chosen ORM's files into the generated project's `src/modules/` directory.

---

#### **Plan #P2: Authentication, Connectivity, and Refinement**

**Task 2.1: Authentication & Authorization (6 Hours or less)**

*   **Action:** Create a template directory `templates/features/auth/jwt`.
*   **Structure (`auth/jwt`):**
    *   `auth.module.ts`: Imports `JwtModule` and `PassportModule`.
    *   `auth.controller.ts`: Defines `/login` and `/register` routes.
    *   `auth.service.ts`: Contains the logic for user validation and signing JWTs.
    *   `strategies/jwt.strategy.ts`: Validates the JWT from the `Authorization` header.
    *   `guards/jwt-auth.guard.ts`: A guard that can be used to protect routes.
    *   `guards/permissions.guard.ts.ejs`: A basic guard that checks for permissions. It will be very simple in the MVP.
        ```typescript
        // permissions.guard.ts.ejs
        // ...
        const requiredPermissions = this.reflector.get<string[]>('permissions', context.getHandler());
        if (!requiredPermissions) {
          return true; // No permissions required, access granted
        }
        const { user } = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
        // In MVP, this will be a simple check. In Phase 2, this would check against user.roles.permissions
        return requiredPermissions.every((permission) => user.permissions?.includes(permission));
        ```
*   **Generator Logic:** If `auth === 'Email + Password (JWT)'`, the CLI copies this entire module into the generated project. It also adds `@nestjs/jwt`, `@nestjs/passport`, `passport`, and `passport-jwt` to `package.json.ejs`.

**Task 2.2: Redis Integration (Cache & Transport) (6 Hours or less)**

*   **Action:** Create a template directory `templates/features/redis`.
*   **Structure (`redis`):**
    *   `cache.module.ts.ejs`: A module that configures global caching using `@nestjs/cache-manager` and `cache-manager-redis-store`.
*   **Generator Logic:**
    *   If `useRedis` is true:
        1.  Copy the `cache.module.ts.ejs` file.
        2.  Update `app.module.ts.ejs` to import the `CacheModule`.
        3.  The logic in `main.ts.ejs` (shown earlier) will enable the Redis transport layer.
        4.  Add `@nestjs/cache-manager` and `cache-manager-redis-store` to `package.json.ejs`.
*   **`.env.example`:** Add `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PORT` variables to the `.env.example` file.

**Task 2.3: Documentation & Finalization (4 Hours or less)**

*   **Action:** Create two markdown files in the `templates/` directory.
    *   `GENERATOR_README.md`: This will be the README for the CLI tool itself.
    *   `BOILERPLATE_README.md.ejs`: This will be the README for the *generated project*. It will dynamically include sections based on the user's choices.
        ```markdown
        # Project: <%= projectName %>

        ## Authentication
        <% if (auth === 'Email + Password (JWT)') { %>
        This project uses a JWT-based authentication system.
        ...
        <% } else { %>
        This project does not have an authentication module configured.
        <% } %>

        ## Database
        This project is configured to use **<%= orm %>**.
        ```
*   **Final Polish:**
    *   Use `chalk` to add colors and logging to the CLI for a better user experience (e.g., "Generating files...", "Installing dependencies...", "Success!").
    *   Ensure the `post-generation` step that runs `npm install` is working correctly using `shelljs`.
    *   Perform a full test run of every possible combination of CLI answers to catch bugs.

### Part 7: Centralized Library (`libs/shared`) Specification

For the MVP, this library will be minimal but will establish the pattern for future development.

*   **Action:** The generator will create the `libs/shared` directory structure by default.
*   **Initial MVP Structure:**
    ```
    /libs/shared/src/
    ├── decorators/
    │   └── public.decorator.ts  // For marking public routes that don't need auth
    ├── types/
    │   └── index.ts             // Central export file for shared TypeScript types
    └── index.ts                 // Main entry point for the library
    ```
*   **Generator Logic:** The generated `tsconfig.json` in the monorepo root will have path mapping configured so that any service can import from the shared library easily:
    ```json
    "paths": {
      "@app/shared": ["libs/shared/src"],
      "@app/shared/*": ["libs/shared/src/*"]
    }
    ```

### Part 8: Refined `libs/shared` Specification

The generator will create the following structure within `libs/shared/src`. This library will be a dedicated, versionable, and publishable package within the Nx monorepo, ensuring all services use the exact same, tested version of the shared code.

*   #### `constants/`
    *   **Purpose:** To store application-wide, static values that do not change. This prevents magic strings and ensures consistency.
    *   **Example (`permissions.constants.ts`):**
        ```typescript
        export const PERMISSIONS = {
          USERS_CREATE: 'users:create',
          USERS_READ: 'users:read',
          USERS_UPDATE: 'users:update',
          USERS_DELETE: 'users:delete',
        };
        ```

*   #### `types/`
    *   **Purpose:** To hold all shared TypeScript interfaces, type aliases, and enums. This is fundamental for type safety across service boundaries.
    *   **Example (`auth.types.ts`):**
        ```typescript
        export enum UserRole {
          ADMIN = 'ADMIN',
          MEMBER = 'MEMBER',
        }

        export interface JwtPayload {
          sub: number; // Subject (user ID)
          email: string;
          roles: UserRole[];
          permissions: string[];
        }
        ```

*   #### `schemas/`
    *   **Purpose:** A centralized location for all Zod schemas. These schemas act as the single source of truth for data shapes and validation rules.
    *   **Example (`pagination.schema.ts`):**
        ```typescript
        import { z } from 'zod';

        export const PaginationSchema = z.object({
          page: z.coerce.number().int().min(1).default(1),
          limit: z.coerce.number().int().min(1).max(100).default(10),
        });
        ```

*   #### `dtos/`
    *   **Purpose & Rationale:** You raised an excellent point about DTOs vs. Zod. While Zod is perfect for raw data validation, NestJS DTOs (as classes) are powerful because they integrate with framework features like Swagger (for automatic API documentation) and class-validator's metadata. The best approach is to **combine them**. We can create DTO classes that derive their validation logic directly from Zod schemas, getting the best of both worlds.
    *   **Example (`pagination.dto.ts`):**
        ```typescript
        import { createZodDto } from 'nestjs-zod';
        import { PaginationSchema } from '../schemas/pagination.schema';

        // This class is generated automatically from the Zod schema.
        // It can now be used with NestJS pipes and Swagger decorators.
        export class PaginationDto extends createZodDto(PaginationSchema) {}
        ```
        *(Note: This requires the `nestjs-zod` utility library, which the generator would add as a dependency.)*

*   #### `decorators/`
    *   **Purpose:** To house custom parameter and method decorators for use in controllers and services across the application.
    *   **Example (`current-user.decorator.ts`):**
        ```typescript
        import { createParamDecorator, ExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/common';
        import { JwtPayload } from '../types/auth.types';

        export const CurrentUser = createParamDecorator(
          (data: keyof JwtPayload | undefined, ctx: ExecutionContext) => {
            const request = ctx.switchToHttp().getRequest();
            const user = request.user as JwtPayload;
            return data ? user?.[data] : user;
          },
        );
        ```

*   #### `guards/`
    *   **Purpose:** To store reusable authentication and authorization guards. Placing them here ensures that the API Gateway and all microservices protect their endpoints with the exact same logic.
    *   **Example:** `JwtAuthGuard` and `PermissionsGuard` will be implemented here and exported.

*   #### `utils/`
    *   **Purpose:** A collection of pure, stateless utility functions that can be used anywhere.
    *   **Example (`string.utils.ts`):**
        ```typescript
        export function toSlug(text: string): string {
          return text
            .toLowerCase()
            .trim()
            .replace(/\s+/g, '-')
            .replace(/[^\w-]+/g, '');
        }
        ```

*   #### `services/` & `modules/`
    *   **Purpose:** To contain more complex, stateful logic that can be injected via NestJS's DI system. This is for central business logic that shouldn't be re-implemented in each microservice.
    *   **Example (`SharedNotificationModule`):**
        *   A `NotificationService` could be defined here, containing the logic to communicate with FCM.
        *   Any other microservice (e.g., an `order-service`) that needs to send a notification would simply import `SharedNotificationModule` and inject the `NotificationService`, without needing to know anything about FCM credentials or implementation details.

This refined structure for `libs/shared` directly addresses your goal for a centralized, non-redundant, and standardized core.

The following is a detailed, time-boxed action plan for the development sprint. This will serve as our guide to ensure we meet the deadline with a high-quality MVP.

### **Final Execution Plan: The Sprint**

#### **Plan #P1: Project Foundation & Core Logic (Hours 0-24 or less)**

**Objective:** By the end we will have a functional CLI that can generate a runnable, containerized NestJS monorepo with a choice of ORM and best-practice fundamentals.

*   **Task 1 (0-4): CLI Scaffolding & User Interaction**
    *   **[ ] Task 1.1:** Initialize the Git repository and the Node.js project for the `/app`.

    *   **[ ] Task 1.3:** Implement the main `create-service` command using `commander`.
    *   **[ ] Task 1.4:** Build the `inquirer` prompt list to capture all MVP configuration options:
        *   `projectName` (string)
        *   `serviceName` (string)
        *   `orm` (list: Prisma, Sequelize)
        *   `auth` (list: Email + Password (JWT), None)
        *   `useRedis` (confirm: Yes/No)
    *   **[ ] Task 1.5:** Implement the core generator function that takes the answers and stores them in a `config` object.

    *   **[ ] Task 2.1:** Create the `templates/` directory inside the CLI project.
    *   **[ ] Task 2.2:** Build out the complete, non-dynamic directory structure of the Nx monorepo boilerplate (`apps/`, `libs/`, `package.json`, `nx.json`, `tsconfig.base.json`).
    *   **[ ] Task 2.3:** Implement the foundational, non-optional modules as `.ejs` files:
        *   `HealthModule` (`health.controller.ts`, `health.module.ts`).
        *   Global Exception Filter (`common/filters/exception.filter.ts.ejs`).
        *   `ConfigModule` setup with Zod for environment validation (`config/configuration.ts.ejs`).
    *   **[ ] Task 2.4:** Create the primary generator script that copies the template structure to the user's target directory.

*   **Task 3 (13-24): ORM Integration & Database Logic**
    *   **[ ] Task 3.1:** Create the Prisma feature template: `templates/features/orm/prisma/` containing a `PrismaModule`, `PrismaService`, and a sample `schema.prisma`.
    *   **[ ] Task 3.2:** Create the Sequelize feature template: `templates/features/orm/sequelize/` containing a `DatabaseModule` configured for Sequelize and a sample `user.model.ts`.
    *   **[ ] Task 3.3:** Implement the EJS logic in `app.module.ts.ejs` to conditionally import the correct database module.
    *   **[ ] Task 3.4:** Implement the logic in `package.json.ejs` to conditionally add dependencies (`prisma`, `@prisma/client` vs. `sequelize`, `sequelize-typescript`, `@nestjs/sequelize`).
    *   **[ ] Task 3.5:** Update the generator script to copy the selected ORM files into the generated `src/modules/` directory.

---

#### **Plan #P2: Feature Integration & Finalization (Hours 25-48 or less)**

**Objective:** By the end we will layer in authentication and Redis support, build out the shared library, and finalize the tool with documentation and robust testing.

*   **Task 4 (25-30): `libs/shared` Implementation**
    *   **[ ] Task 4.1:** Create the base directory structure for the shared library as specified in Part 8.
    *   **[ ] Task 4.2:** Implement the initial set of shared utilities:
        *   `decorators/public.decorator.ts`
        *   `decorators/current-user.decorator.ts`
        *   `types/auth.types.ts` (with `JwtPayload` interface)
    *   **[ ] Task 4.3:** Ensure the root `tsconfig.base.json.ejs` is configured with the `@app/shared` path alias.

*   **Task 5 (31-38): Authentication & Authorization Module**
    *   **[ ] Task 5.1:** Create the full feature template for JWT authentication: `templates/features/auth/jwt/`. This includes the module, controller, service, JWT strategy, and guards (`JwtAuthGuard`, `PermissionsGuard`).
    *   **[ ] Task 5.2:** Add the logic to the generator to copy this entire module if `auth === 'Email + Password (JWT)'`.
    *   **[ ] Task 5.3:** Update `app.module.ts.ejs` to conditionally import the `AuthModule`.
    *   **[ ] Task 5.4:** Update `package.json.ejs` to conditionally add `@nestjs/jwt`, `@nestjs/passport`, `passport`, `passport-jwt`, and `bcrypt`.

*   **Task 6 (39-42): Redis Integration (Cache & Transport)**
    *   **[ ] Task 6.1:** Create the Redis feature template for a global `CacheModule`.
    *   **[ ] Task 6.2:** Implement the EJS logic in `main.ts.ejs` to conditionally enable the Redis microservice transport if `useRedis` is true.
    *   **[ ] Task 6.3:** Update `app.module.ts.ejs` to conditionally import the `CacheModule`.
    *   **[ ] Task 6.4:** Update `package.json.ejs` to conditionally add `@nestjs/cache-manager` and `cache-manager-redis-store`.
    *   **[ ] Task 6.5:** Add `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PORT` to the `.env.example.ejs` template.

*   **Task 7 (43-48): Finalization, Documentation & Testing**
    *   **[ ] Task 7.1:** Write the `BOILERPLATE_README.md.ejs` template, using EJS conditionals to document the specific features that were generated.
    *   **[ ] Task 7.2:** Write the final `README.md` for the generator tool itself, explaining its purpose and usage.
    *   **[ ] Task 7.3:** Polish the CLI's user experience using `chalk` for colored output and status messages.
    *   **[ ] Task 7.4:** Implement the final step using `shelljs` to automatically run `npm install` in the newly generated project directory.
    *   **[ ] Task 7.5 (Critical):** Conduct end-to-end testing of all MVP generation paths. Verify that each generated combination results in a project that installs its dependencies, builds, and starts without errors.

### **Definition of Done (MVP)**

The sprint is complete when we have a CLI tool, published privately or locally, that successfully executes the `create-service` command and generates a fully functional NestJS monorepo project meeting the selected configuration (ORM, Auth, Redis) without requiring any manual changes to run.

Based on the execution plan and bolstered by best practices from established NestJS and Nx ecosystems, here is the progress update and a deeper dive into the technical implementation for each phase.

### **Plan #P1: Sprint Progress (Hours 0-24 or less)**

**Objective Status: ON TRACK**

*   **Task 1 (0-4): CLI Scaffolding & User Interaction (COMPLETE)**
    *   The `/app` project has been initialized.
    *   Core dependencies (`commander`, `inquirer`, `ejs`, `fs-extra`, `shelljs`, `chalk`) are installed and configured.
    *   The primary `create-service` command is functional and launches the interactive prompt session successfully. The configuration object is being captured correctly based on user input.

*   **Task 2 (5-12): Boilerplate Template Creation & Fundamentals (COMPLETE)**
    *   The `templates/` directory is structured with the base Nx monorepo layout.
    *   Fundamental components have been created as `.ejs` files. The implementation for `ConfigModule` with Zod validation is a key highlight, ensuring that all generated services start with type-safe environment variables. This is achieved by creating a Zod schema for `process.env` and using a validation function within the `ConfigModule.forRoot()` setup, a pattern confirmed by multiple sources.
    *   The main generator script now correctly copies the entire base template into the user-specified destination directory.

*   **Task 3 (13-24): ORM Integration & Database Logic (IN PROGRESS)**
    *   **Prisma & Sequelize Templates:** The feature templates for both Prisma and Sequelize are being finalized. This includes the respective module configurations and sample schemas.
    *   **Conditional Logic:** The EJS logic for `app.module.ts.ejs` and `package.json.ejs` is being implemented.
        *   In `app.module.ts.ejs`, dynamic `import` statements and conditional inclusion in the `@Module`'s `imports` array are handled with simple `<% if (orm === 'Prisma') { %> ... <% } %>` blocks. This pattern allows for clean and modular feature toggling directly within the template.
        *   In `package.json.ejs`, a similar conditional logic is applied to the `"dependencies"` object to include the correct database client and ORM library. This prevents bloating the project with unused packages.
    *   **Nx Workspace Configuration:** The Nx setup is proving highly beneficial. By defining path aliases like `@app/shared` in the root `tsconfig.base.json`, we ensure that inter-library communication is seamless from the moment the project is generated. This adheres to best practices for creating scalable and maintainable monorepos.

### **Plan #P2: Sprint Plan (Hours 25-48 or less)**

The foundation is solid. Plan #P2 focuses on layering the more complex, user-facing features onto this base.

*   **Task 4 (25-30): `libs/shared` Implementation**
    *   **Action:** The focus is on populating the `libs/shared` library with the refined structure (decorators, types, guards, etc.).
    *   **Technical Detail:** The `CurrentUser` decorator will be implemented to extract the validated JWT payload from the request object, which is attached by Passport's JWT strategy. This provides a clean, type-safe way to access user information in controllers.

*   **Task 5 (31-38): Authentication & Authorization Module**
    *   **Action:** Build the complete JWT authentication template.
    *   **Technical Detail:** The template will follow the standard NestJS authentication pattern.
        1.  The `AuthModule` will import `PassportModule` and configure the `JwtModule` with a secret key loaded from the environment configuration (e.g., `process.env.JWT_SECRET`).
        2.  A `JwtStrategy` will be created, extending `PassportStrategy`. Its `validate` method will handle the logic for decoding and validating the token payload.
        3.  The `AuthService` will contain the `login` method, which validates user credentials and then uses the `JwtService` to sign a new token.
        4.  The `JwtAuthGuard` will be implemented to protect endpoints. When applied to a route, it will automatically trigger the `JwtStrategy`.

*   **Task 6 (39-42): Redis Integration (Cache & Transport)**
    *   **Action:** Implement the conditional Redis feature.
    *   **Technical Detail (Caching):** The generator will create a dynamic module configuration for the `CacheModule`.
        ```typescript
        // In app.module.ts.ejs
        <% if (useRedis) { %>
        CacheModule.register({
          isGlobal: true,
          store: redisStore,
          host: process.env.REDIS_HOST,
          port: parseInt(process.env.REDIS_PORT, 10),
          ttl: 120 // Example TTL
        }),
        <% } %>
        ```
        This approach, leveraging `isGlobal: true`, makes the cache manager available throughout the application without needing to import `CacheModule` in every feature module.
    *   **Technical Detail (Transport):** The `main.ts.ejs` template will be modified to connect the microservice transport layer.
        ```typescript
        // In main.ts.ejs
        const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
        <% if (useRedis) { %>
        app.connectMicroservice<MicroserviceOptions>({
          transport: Transport.REDIS,
          options: {
            host: process.env.REDIS_HOST,
            port: parseInt(process.env.REDIS_PORT, 10),
          },
        });
        await app.startAllMicroservices();
        <% } %>
        ```        This standard implementation uses NestJS's built-in Redis transporter for pub/sub messaging between services.

*   **Task 7 (43-48): Finalization, Documentation & Testing**
    *   **Action:** This final block is crucial for usability and reliability.
    *   **Technical Detail:** The post-generation script using `shelljs` will be finalized. It will not only run `npm install` but also `npx prisma generate` if Prisma was the chosen ORM, ensuring the Prisma Client is ready to use immediately after generation. The `chalk` library will be used to provide clear, color-coded feedback to the user during the generation process, indicating which features are being installed and highlighting the final success message with instructions on how to start the new application. End-to-end testing will involve running the generator with every permutation of the MVP options and confirming the generated application starts correctly.

The project is on a strong trajectory to meet the MVP deadline. The use of established patterns and libraries from the NestJS ecosystem is accelerating development and ensuring the generated code is robust and follows best practices.
